Create a set of instructions, as detailed as possible about one of the classic card games, that you observe.

War
Rules :
1.2 players
2.Each player gets 26 cards
3.Each stack of 26 must be faced down
4.One card from each person is turned over at the same time


Instructions :
There can only be 2 players :
	Each player turns over one card.
	Look to see who has the bigger card :
Whoever has the bigger card gets both that card and the opponents card.
  If both cards are the same :
  Put 3 cards facing down and side by side for each player and each player flip over any card in their row of three.Whoever
  has the bigger card, gets all 6 cards and puts them face down under their stack :
    If the cards are the same(and continue being the same) then keep turning over the row of three until one is bigger.
    Do this everytime players turn the same card.
Continue to flip the cards until one person has all of the cards:
  Whoever holds more cards than the other, wins.
